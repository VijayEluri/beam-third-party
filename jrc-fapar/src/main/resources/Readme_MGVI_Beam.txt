Document title:	Documentation of the FAPAR Processor, a plug-in for MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox (BEAM)

Release date : 

	version 2.1 : December 2007
	version 2.0 : 11 April 2005
	version 1.0 : 4 October 2004


Introduction
------------

This file briefly describes the installation and use of the accompanying software package, which computes the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), on the basis of ENVISAT/MERIS Level-1 data, following the algorithm described in the papers cited in the references section below.

Requirements
------------

The FAPAR processor is a plug-in module for the BEAM software developed by Brockmann Consult for ESA. 
This latter software must of course be installed prior to the FAPAR processor.

The BEAM software includes an application programming interface (API) and a set of executable tools to facilitate the use of MERIS, AATSR and further ASAR data products of the ESA ENVISAT satellite. It can be freely downloaded from:

http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/downloads.html

WARNING: FAPAR processor version 2.1 needs BEAM VISAT Version 4.0 or more while the version 1.0 can be run under previous BEAM releases.

Installation
------------

The BEAM package (here : BEAM VISAT Version 3.2) is installed within a particular, user-selectable, directory. For the purpose of this documentation file, that directory will be denoted $BEAM_DIR$.

CASE 1: Already built JAR file, containing classes:
---------------------------------------------------
The FAPAR processor package (.zip) normally contains the module in the form of a Java-archive file (fapar-processor-2.x.jar) and this readmeMGVI_BEAM.txt file . All that has to be done is to copy the .jar file to $BEAM_DIR$/modules/.

CASE 2: Build from Source code
------------------------------
If instead of the jar file (which should contain only java classes and the /help and /DOC directories) there are only the source files (.java files) the processor should be built from scratch. Ensure the following:
	- The directory ./com/bc/beam/processor/fapar/ exists. If not, create it.
        - The paths in the top section of the "build.sh" installation script
          exist and are suitable 
Then, in the directory of the sources, run the "build.sh" script. This should
compile and install the package. Running the script with the "-d" option will
also rebuild the documentation, using javadoc.
	 

Operation
---------

Once the BEAM software and the FAPAR processor have been installed, the package can be operated in two different modes: interactive and automatic.

To launch an interactive session, start the main BEAM software application (VISAT) and select the FAPAR processor using the following menu selections: Tools -> FAPAR Processor. A dialog window will appear:

	- Select the input file containing the MERIS Level-1 data to be processed.
	- Specify the output file where you want the results to be written.
	- Select the output format from the pull-down menu, if different from the BEAM default.
	- Optionally, save this configuration in a separate XML file, known to BEAM software as a (reusable) 'processing request'.
	- Initiate the FAPAR processor itself by clicking on the 'start' button.


To process one or more data sets automatically, i.e., without requiring manual input, it is also possible to launch the application from the command line (or an executable script, for that matter). 

At the operating system prompt (if you have defined $BEAM_HOME to something like /opt/beam4.1 ), type:

	$BEAM_HOME/bin/fapar.sh [options] [processing_request]

where [processing_request] stands for the name of the corresponding file, which can either be saved from an interactive session or created manually with a plain text editor.
Note: In fapar.sh you can adjust the Java minimum and maximum heap space with the java options -Xms(minimum) and -Xmx(maximum). 
	Example: r_processor.jar [options] [processing_request]

For the options, refer to the "Data Processors" section in the "Help" of VISAT.

The BEAM 'processing request', an XML file (in plain ASCII, with a '.xml' extension), must be supplied when the processor runs in non-interactive mode. In interactive mode, the request is an optional command line argument. Again, for more details, refer to "Help" in the VISAT window.

Help For The Plug-In
--------------------

The FAPAR processor version 2.x is provided with a help directory named 'fapar_processor'.
This help directory must be copied into $BEAM_DIR$/extensions. The help can then be viewed directly in the help menu of the VISAT application or from the processor help menu.

Changelog
---------

Changes from version 1.0 to version 2.0:

- Fapar Processor 2.0 can write the output in HDF5 as well as BEAM-DIMAP
- A Help directory is provided that enable the user to find more information about the processor directly from BEAM VISAT Help menu.
- Output bands reflectances and rectified reflectances are set as sprectal bands and can be viewed using the spectrum tool. Bands can be viewed all together but it is also possible to view only some bands by selecting them in the spectrum tool.
- Fapar Processor 2.0 uses the processor API as of BEAM 3.1 and thus can not be run with BEAM VISAT previous versions

Changes from version 2.0 to 2.1

- Necessary code modifications and file additions (module.xml) to accomodate the structure of Beam 4.1. This version CANNOT be used on earlier versions of BEAM-VISAT.
- The processor can work either with plain MERIS data or with AMORGOS data output, carrying the extra bands CorrectedLatitude and CorrectedLongitude.
