<h1>FAPAR Algorithm Specification</h1>

<p>The FAPAR algorithm is described in detail in the <a title="Download ATBD in PDF format"
                                                        href="http://fapar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/Data/Pages/FAPAR_Home/FAPAR_Home_Publications/atbd_mgvi_jrc.pdf"><cite>Algorithm
    Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)</cite></a> which can be freely downloaded from the FAPAR website. The information
    provided below provides a short summary of essential information and does not replace the ATBD.</p>

<h2>FAPAR</h2>

<p>The FAPAR algorithm consists in a set of rules designed to generate useful information on the state and productivity
    of the vegetation on land. Particular attention has been given to ensure that these products are uncontaminated by
    atmospheric effects (in particular aerosols), soil colour changes and anisotropic influences associated with the
    particular geometry of illumination and observation at the time of the measurements.</p>

<p>The FAPAR Processor distributed for use with the BEAM Toolbox is specifically designed to analyze MERIS data and
    computes equivalent values of the MGVI and associated rectified channels which are the current Level 2 MERIS land
    products.</p>

<p>Starting from version 2.2, rectified channels over bare soil are also provided.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The presence of vegetation on land exploit the fact that live green vegetation is highly reflecting in the
    near-infrared and is quite absorbing in the red spectral bands. The top of atmosphere reflectances are however
    strongly contaminated by the presence and properties of aerosols and water vapour in the atmosphere, can vary
    significantly with soil brightness changes (e.g., following rain events) and are very sensitive to the anisotropy of
    the surface (i.e., to the relative angular positions of the Sun and of the observing instrument).</p>

<p>The FAPAR algorithm used in this processor has been specifically designed to address these shortcomings and to
    provide not just a qualitative indicator but a quantitative estimate of an actual biophysical variable that is
    directly relevant to the physiology of the plants. It is optimized for the MERIS instrument, uses a spectral band in
    the blue region to characterize the atmospheric aerosol effects, and takes into account the typical anisotropy of
    vegetation covers. For a detailed description of the design of the algorithm, please refer to the ATBD that is
    distributed with the Processor.</p>

<div class="inote">
    <p><strong>Please note that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A detailed understanding of the design of the algorithm may be useful to its performances, but is not
            necessary to generate the product with the Processor or to use this product in practical applications.
        </li>
        <li>Similar FAPAR algorithms have been also designed for other Earth orbiting sensors (e.g., SeaWiFS, MISR,
            Vegetation, and GLI). Because each of them is specifically crafted for each particular sensor, the products
            generated from anyone of these processors are <u>directly comparable</u> and users can mix and match such
            products without having to be concerned about the origin of the data (as long as the appropriate algorithm
            is used).
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>In practice, the FAPAR Processor works in four steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>The measured radiances at the top of reflectances are first converted into bidirectional reflectances factors
        (BRFs).
    </li>
    <li>The vegetated land pixels are then detected by a multi-spectral threshold algorithm. This informs about the
        nature of non-vegetated pixels like bare soil, bright surfaces, or cloud shadow contamination pixels.
    </li>
    <li>The BRFs are corrected from angular effects thank to a parametric model. The blue band is then used, in
        conjunction with the red and near-infrared observations, to generate an intermediary product known as the <i>rectified
            red</i> and <i>near-infrared</i> bands: these essentially represent standardized measurements, in these two
        spectral bands, decontaminated from atmospheric and anisotropic effects. This component of the algorithm takes
        explicitly into account the characteristics of the orbit and the spectral band passes of the MERIS instrument.
    </li>
    <li>When bright surfaces is detected specific <em>rectified red</em> and <em>near-infrared</em> bands are computed
        using different coefficients for the parametric model.
    </li>
    <li>The last step consists in computing FAPAR from the two rectified channels and in generating the associated flag
        values.
    </li>
</ol>
