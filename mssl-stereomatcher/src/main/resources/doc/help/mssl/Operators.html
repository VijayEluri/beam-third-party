<h1>Operators</h1>

<p>The functionality of the MSSL stereo-matcher is broken down into several operators that
must be chained together to either retrieve geometric cloud-top height or to determine the
co-registration shift in ATSR data. The chain begins with an ATSR data file to produce
intermediate target products that serve as source products for the next step.</p>
<p>This section briefly introduces the available operators:</p>

<h3>Image Normaliser</h3>
<p>The image normaliser operator implements the normalisation
function described in Muller et al. (2007). It takes two input bands, which can be set as
processing parameters, and maps these into a three target bands each: a normalised
view of the data, a regional standard deviation and a regional mean. For convenience
the input bands are copied into the target product.</p>

<h3>Filter Sun Elevation</h3>
<p>This operator implements a spatial filter to reduce the
dataset that will be processed by the stereo-matcher based on the sun-elevation data
contained in the ATSR file. If it is desired to process only day-light data, the sun elevation
processing parameter could be set to 10.0. This will produce a target product
containing a band with the name <span class="code">filter</span> where only values with a higher sun elevation
are set to 1. The stereo matching module will ignore data where the value is set to
any other value. The use of this operator is not required.</p>

<h3>M4 Stereo Matcher</h3>
<p>The M4 stereo matcher implements the fast M4 stereo
matcher based on phase correlation shift (Muller et al. 2007). It takes as source products
the output of the image normaliser and optionally a filter. A filter source product
must always be set (a limitation in the BEAM GUI), but is only activated if the
<span class="code">Apply filter</span> box is ticked. Other processing parameters include the size of the search window
and the value for no data. The target product contains three output bands: YDisparities,
containing the disparity in the along-track direction, XDisparities, containing
the disparity in the across-track direction, and the match quality. The stereo-matching
is the most time consuming task and processing an entire orbit can take as long as one
hour on a current personal computer.</p>

<h3>M5 Stereo Matcher</h3>
<p>The M5 stereo matcher implements a stereo-matcher very
similar to M4, but with an exhaustive search within the search window. The same
processing parameters as with M4 apply.</p>

<h3>Mannstein Camera Model</h3>
<p>This operator translates along-track disparities into
geometric cloud-top height using the Mannstein camera model (Denis et al. 2007). Processing
parameters are minimum and maximum cloud-top height, a disparity offset
to compensate for a shift in co-registration, and the instrument half-cone angle.</p>

<h3>Filter Clear Land</h3>
<p>This operator assists in the detection of the co-registration shift
by masking out all areas that are either over sea or cloudy. As the stereo-matching process
is affected by clouds in the vicinity of the pixel analysed the processing parameter 
<span class="code">cloud radius</span> gives the radius of cloud-free pixels required to classify a pixel as clear.</p>

<h3>Expected Disparities</h3>
<p>When determining the co-registration shift expected disparities
or parallax arising from terrain must be taken into account. This operator computes
the expected parallax based on the assumption that every 800m of elevation will
result in a one pixel disparity.</p>

<h3>Image Coregistration</h3>
<p>This operator takes three source products: disparities resulting from one of the stereo matchers (M4 or M5), a viewfilter (e.g. clear land filter)
and expected disparities and computes an output band of elevation corrected disparities,
which should give an indication of the image shift present between nadir and
forward view.</p>
