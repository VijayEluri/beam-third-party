<h3>Operator description</h3>

<p>
    The FUB/WeW Water Processor Op makes use of MERIS Level-1b TOA radiances in the
    bands 1-7, 9-10 and 12-14 to retrieve the following case II water properties and
    atmospheric properties above case II waters :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>chlorophyll-a concentration (log scale, mg/m^3)</li>
    <li>yellow substance absorption @ 443 nm (log scale, 1/m)</li>
    <li>total suspended matter concentration (log scale, g/m^3)</li>
    <li>yellow substance absorption @ 443 nm (log scale, 1/m)</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 440 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 550 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 670 nm</li>
    <li>aerosol optical depth @ 870 nm</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 412 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 442 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 490 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 510 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 560 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 620 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 665 nm (1/sr)</li>
    <li>water-leaving RS reflectance @ 708 nm (1/sr)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The retrieval is based on four separate artificial neural networks which
were trained on the basis of the results of extensive radiative transfer
simulations with the MOMO code by taking varying atmospheric and oceanic
conditions into account. All networks were validated against in-situ
measurements.
</p>

<p>
During the Plugin processing the MERIS Level-1b data are masked prior to
the retrival by applying the following combination mask :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>GLINT_RISK</li>
    <li>BRIGHT</li>
    <li>INVALID</li>
    <li>SUSPECT (only when not masking out almost all pixels)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The masked pixel's values are set to 5.
</p>

<p>
Non-masked pixels are then normalized for an atmosphere's ozone contents of
344 Dobson units by calculating transmission correction factors.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the AOT wavelengths 440, 670 and 870 nm correspond to the
AERONET data wavelengths for a convenient direct comparison with in situ data.
</p>

<p>
Each pixel is checked against the input and output values margin of the
trained networks. Additional flags are set in case of a neural network
failure for input and output separately.
</p>

<p>
The radiative transfer simulation code and the retrieval algorithm are
described in detail in the papers cited in the references section below.
We would like to stress the fact that the operator is applicable over
case II only, thus it is likely to fail over the open ocean by producing
negative remote sensing (RS) water-leaving reflectances.
</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The FUB/WeW water processor op can be invoked from the VISAT tool menu by selecting
    the <b>FUB/WeW WATER Processor Op (MERIS)</b> command. On the command line the FUB/WeW water processor op is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM <code>bin</code>
    directory. Typing <code>gpt FUB.Water -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>FUB/WeW WATER Processor Op (MERIS)</b> command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/FUBWeW.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source product:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in VISAT:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
    the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The FUB/WeW water processing is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the
    processing is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<h5>Menu Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b>
    The entries found in this menu allow to save the current processing parameters to disk and to open a saved parameter
    set from disk.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Displays this help page.
