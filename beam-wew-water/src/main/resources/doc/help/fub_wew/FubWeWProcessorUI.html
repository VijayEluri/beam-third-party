<h3>Processor Description</h3>


<p>
    The FUB/WeW Water Processor can be invoked from the VISAT tool menu by selecting
    the <b>MERIS FUB/WeW WATER Processor</b> command. On the command line the FUB/WeW Water Processor is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM <code>bin</code>
    directory. Typing <code>gpt FUB.Water -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>MERIS FUB/WeW WATER Processor</b> command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:
</p>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/FUBWeW_IOParameters.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source product:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in VISAT:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
    the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The FUB/WeW water processing is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the
    processing is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<h5>Menu Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b>
    The entries found in this menu allow to save the current processing parameters to disk and to open a saved parameter
    set from disk.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Access to this help pages and to an About dialog.
</p>

<h4>Processing Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/FUBWeW_ProcessingParameters.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute chlorophyll-a concentration band: </b><br>
    Whether chlorophyll-a concentration band shall be computed.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute yellow substances band: </b><br>
    Whether yellow substances band shall be computed.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute total suspended matter band: </b><br>
    Whether total suspended matter band shall be computed.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute water leaving reflectances and AOT bands: </b><br>
    Whether atmospheric correction bands shall be computed
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Check whether l1_flags.SUSPECT is valid: </b><br>
    Performs a check whether the l1_flags.SUSPECT shall be considered in an expression.
    This parameter is only considered when the expression contains the term 'and not l1_flags.SUSPECT'".
    This test is useful because some MERIS Level 1b scenes mark almost all pixels as suspect. If more than 50%
    of the pixel of an line in the scene center are marked as suspect than the suspect flag is removed from
    the expression.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use valid pixel expression: </b><br>
    Band maths expression which defines valid pixels. If the expression is empty, all pixels will be
    considered as valid. The default value for the expression is <br>
    "not l1_flags.GLINT_RISK and not l1_flags.BRIGHT and not l1_flags.INVALID and not l1_flags.SUSPECT"
