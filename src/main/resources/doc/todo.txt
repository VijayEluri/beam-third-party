Programming
===========
+ nf,nf: check: ToaVegProcessor.getConfigPath, leading "/"
+ nf,nf: check: ToaVegProcessor.retrieveCurrentPath does nothing
+ nf,nf: generalize TOA-VEG  auxdata access for VISAT/BEAM integr. and stand-alone
         redefine ToaVegConstants.AUXDATA_PATH as AUXDATA_DIR
         redefine ToaVegConstants.CONFIG_PATH as CONFIG_FILE
         access system property "toaveg.auxdata.dir" in method
         ToaVegProcessor.getAuxdataDir
+ nf,nf: Change TOA-VEG constants and related tests which explicitely
         used UNIX file separator '/'. On Windows OS systems, related tests fail.
+ nf,nf: move init code in processor constr. to Processor.initProcessor method
+ nf,nf: need a reasonable default output file name in TOA-VEG processor UI
o nf,nf: generalize auxdata access for other processors as well
- nf,nf: update UI, split into "I/O" and "Processing params"

Configuration
=============
+ nf,nf: add 'readme.txt' and 'changelog.txt'
+ nf,nf: add 'build.xml' for apache ant
+ nf,nf: add new source directory 'test' to CVS and move all existing test cases here
+ nf,cc: add some basic documentation to the merisveg-readme.txt regarding the TOA-VEG processor, e.g. what
         goes in and what comes out.
- nf,nf: talk with Carine about unit-level testing, philosophy, (non)sense of constant-testing

Integration
===========
+ cc,nf: integrate help pages
+ nf,cc: build plug-in JAR, test using BEAM 3.2, distribute
o cc,cc: provide help documentation
o cc,nf: verify BEAM integration
- cc,nf: integrate code into BEAM CVS repository
